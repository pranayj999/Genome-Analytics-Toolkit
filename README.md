Genome Analytics Toolkit

Overview

The Genome Analytics Toolkit (BioSeqInsight) is a comprehensive Python-based toolkit designed to analyze genomic data efficiently. It integrates advanced algorithms like Suffix Trees and Heavy Path Decomposition, and provides visualization and REST API capabilities to cater to researchers, bioinformaticians, and developers.

This toolkit is built to handle large genomic datasets, compute sequence mappability scores, and support mutation analysis through exact and approximate pattern matching.

Key Features

1. Efficient Suffix Tree Construction

Constructs a suffix tree for a given sequence to enable substring queries.

Supports visualization of tree structure for better insights.

Handles large datasets with optimized memory usage.

2. Heavy Path Decomposition (HPD)

Decomposes a tree into heavy paths for efficient traversal and querying.

Identifies paths with the highest computational relevance.

3. Mappability Analysis

Computes F0 (exact match) and F1 (one mismatch) scores for substrings.

Identifies unique and repetitive genomic regions to assist in sequence analysis and probe design.

4. Visualization Tools

Generates heatmaps for mutation-prone regions and visual graphs for suffix trees and heavy paths.

Provides interactive visualizations suitable for publications and presentations.

5. REST API

A Flask-based REST API enables remote querying and integration with other bioinformatics pipelines.

Supports programmatic access for genomic analysis.

6. Batch Processing

Process multiple genomic files in one run, outputting results for comparative analysis.

Use Cases

Genome Mapping

Identify unique and repetitive regions in large genomes to assist in sequencing projects.

Mutation Analysis

Analyze mutation-prone areas using k-mismatch substring queries for genetic research.

Probe/Primer Design

Leverage mappability scores to select regions for probe and primer design in genetic testing.

Bioinformatics Pipelines

Integrate with existing workflows to automate genomic data preprocessing and analysis.

Installation

Prerequisites

Python 3.8 or higher

pip (Python package manager)

Steps

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/genome-analytics-toolkit.git
cd genome-analytics-toolkit

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

(Optional) Create a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows

Usage

Suffix Tree Module

Build a suffix tree and query substrings:

python src/suffix_tree.py

Code Example:

from suffix_tree import SuffixTree

sequence = "ACGTACGT"
tree = SuffixTree(sequence)
print("Indices for 'ACG':", tree.search("ACG"))

Heavy Path Decomposition Module

Perform heavy path decomposition on a tree:

python src/heavy_path_decomposition.py

Code Example:

from heavy_path_decomposition import HeavyPathDecomposition

tree = HeavyPathDecomposition()
tree.add_node(1)  # Root

Mappability Analysis Module

Compute mappability scores for a sequence:

python src/mappability_analysis.py

Code Example:

from mappability_analysis import MappabilityAnalysis

sequence = "ACGTACGT"
substring_length = 3
analyzer = MappabilityAnalysis(sequence, substring_length)

f0, f1 = analyzer.compute_scores()
analyzer.display_scores(f0, f1)

Visualization Module

Generate heatmaps and graphs for analysis:

python src/visualizer.py

Code Example:

from visualizer import Visualizer

data = {"ACG": 2, "CGT": 3}
Visualizer.plot_mappability(data, "Mappability Scores")

Run the REST API

Start the REST API server:

python src/api_server.py

Access the API at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

Example API Call:

curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/analyze \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"sequence": "ACGTACGT", "substring_length": 3}'

Sample Response:

{
    "f0_scores": {"ACG": 2, "CGT": 3},
    "f1_scores": {"ACG": 3, "CGT": 4}
}
